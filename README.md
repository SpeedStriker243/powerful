# So you want to be POWERFUL?!
> The following instructions are for Windows only.
## Let's get started!
First make sure you can run `powerful` from the command line. To check, type `powerful` into CMD. If it runs, then skip to the next bit.
If you get this:
```
'powerful' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
then you need to make sure CMD recognises `powerful.exe`. You can do this by simply CDing to its path, for example, if it was in Downloads (where USERNAME is your current Windows username):
```
cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads
```
If you want to run the program anywhere, you're going to want to add it to your PATH. [Here's how.](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)

## Doing the thing
Once you've done either of these things, simply type 'powerful' followed by any number.
Here's what it does:
